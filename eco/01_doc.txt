SMART METER DATA
----------------

Measurement period:
01.06.12 to 31.01.13

Coverage:
No. days: 245, Coverage: 99.64%

Limitation:
The first 29 days (i.e., from 01.06.12 to 29.06.12), each of the power measurements has been rounded to 10W precision.

Description:

Each CVS file contains aggregate consumption data of a single day and is named accordingly (e.g., "2012-08-31.csv"). Each file contains 86,400 rows (i.e., one row for each second). Rows with missing measurements are denoted as "-1". The coverage specifies the proportion of "existing" values, i.e., values that are > -1.

The rows consist of the following comma separated values:

* powerallphases: Sum of real power over all phases
* powerl1: Real power phase 1
* powerl2: Real power phase 2
* powerl3: Real power phase 3
* currentneutral: Neutral current
* currentl1: Current phase 1
* currentl2: Current phase 2
* currentl3: Current phase 3
* voltagel1: Voltage phase 1
* voltagel2: Voltage phase 2
* voltagel3: Voltage phase 3
* phaseanglevoltagel2l1: Phase shift between voltage on phase 2 and 1
* phaseanglevoltagel3l1: Phase shift between voltage on phase 3 and 1
* phaseanglecurrentvoltagel1: Phase shift between current/voltage on phase 1
* phaseanglecurrentvoltagel2: Phase shift between current/voltage on phase 2 
* phaseanglecurrentvoltagel3: Phase shift between current/voltage on phase 3

We also provide Matlab files, which contain the same data stored as Matlab structs (using the field names described above). Each Matlab file contains aggregate consumption data of a single day (e.g., "2012-08-31.mat") and contains a single struct. The name of the struct encodes the date, number of household, and type of data ("00" represents a smart meter, "01" represents plug no. 1, ...). For instance, "Appliance010020120831" contains smart meter data from household 01 measured on August 31st, 2012.


PLUG DATA
---------

Measurement period:
01.06.12 to 23.01.13

01: Fridge (no. days: 231, coverage: 98.53%)
02: Dryer (no. days: 231, coverage: 98.56%)
03: Coffee machine (no. days: 113, coverage: 85.36%)
04: Kettle (no. days: 203, coverage: 77.65%)
05: Washing machine (no. days: 231, coverage: 98.56%)
06: PC (no,. days: 66, coverage: 84.77%) (*)
07: Freezer (no. days: 231, coverage: 98.56%)

Comments:

(*) Including router

Description: 

Like the smart meter data, the plug data is also provided on a daily based (i.e., 86,400 measurements per day) both in CSV and Matlab format. In contrast to the smart meter data, it contains only one value:

* consumption: Real power measured by the plug

Each file contains plug measurements for the whole household. The (daily) data for each plug is stored in subfolders named after the plug ID (e.g., "05") described above.



OCCUPANCY DATA
--------------

The occupancy data is available for summer (01_summer.csv) and winter (01_winter.csv).
Each row in the csv file represents a day (specified by the first column). Each day consists of 86400 fields indicating presence (1) and absence (0) for each second of the day. Thus the csv file contains 86401 columns.

Occupants specified presence/absence through a tablet computer. As this process is prone to errors (like any method capturing ground truth...) we filtered the data as described in our paper "Occupancy Detection from Electricity Consumption Data". Here we provide the filtered data, which we also used for our analysis to infer occupancy from electricity consumption data.
